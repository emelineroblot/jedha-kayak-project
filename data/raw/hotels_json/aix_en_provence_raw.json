Small parking making it difficult for our SUV. We parked at the parking relay Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Pierre 7 mins away that also offers free shuttle back to La Roronde (12 mns) near the hotel. We left the car for 3 days while visiting Aix and walked everywhere. It was perfect and parking is cheap $3.50/24 hrs. A nice option to know since it is difficult to park in Aix."

Really to say something:\r\n- Gluten free option at Breakfast was very, very limited.\r\n- 16€/day parking on top of the room rate, is a bit expensive.\r\n- Maybe increase the pool time in the evening (only 20:00)"

The bed was comfortable. \nThe staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the front desk to the restaurant and waiters. We appreciated the fabulous service from them all, especially looking after our little dog, Charlee with extra water bowls, and a bed. \n\nThe breakfast buffet has a lavish selection and loved that they custom make any extra eggs or food that you like. \n\nAnd the dining room by night served a five star Michelin gourmet meal with an excellent team from the kitchen. \n\nWe loved a lot of the little extras like cold water bottles in our car every time, the fedora hats, flip-flops and beach bag in the room. The housekeeping could use a little better follow-through. We ran out of things throughout our stay like toilet paper, bath soap, the second bathrobe didn’t come back. They were quick to bring it when we found, but it was a bit of a hassle, running out of things.  \n\nAlso, the Jacuzzi temperature was freezing. It would be nice to have it hotter, especially in the cold weather. \n\nIt was a little further away from the center than we would’ve liked. The walk was doable but being closer what happened nicer"

We had a junior suite so we had a large room overlooking the well tended grounds and a bathroom with 2 sinks & shower big enough for 2 shower heads. It was the most comfortable bed of our entire trip. Breakfast was a lovely buffet - we ate outside because the weather was perfect. We loved sitting by the pool after a long day of sight seeing. The staff were friendly and professional. Nothing - great stay"

Oh, and storage space was good for such a small place (nice big drawers under the sink) and there was a heating rack in the bathroom. (These features were missing in the much more expensive place to which we moved next.) We found it odd that it opened directly to the outside, like a motel, which seemed less secure. Perhaps that’s nice in the summer? Space was tight (but not surprising for the price).  It was unfortunate that all three beds were in the same room, as one of us snored (but again, not surprising for the price)."

Opening the French doors to the balcony and looking out at the action on le Mirabeau was awesome. The property is a mix of very old world and super modern. The descending the steps to the spa is like entering another dimension! The amenities like washing machine, dishwasher, cook top made us wish we could have stayed longer. The market Tuesday mornings right out the front door is super special. Highly recommended. The sleeping loft has some beams that make you duck as you move around, but easy to adapt to."

It was a great introduction to Provence with custom bedding and curtains. Modern bathroom, lift for easy access to upper rooms. Breakfast was delightful! We had a wonderful time there and it was so convenient!! Best with no car as no parking at hotel. Loved it all!"

There was free street parking. \nPrice was reasonable given location.\nThe hotel original style is preserved with very much everything antique, including the bedrooms which are small, with red carpet, and old furniture. For people who like modern facilities with clean look this is not for you. The rooms are simple and you feel you are at your grandmother's house. Notheless, that helped us feel immersed in that era. The bathroom was OK. The shower head was only a handheld one, so it can be annoying.\nBreakfast was not worth it.\nStaff was kind of cold."

I stayed because my apartment was not ready in Aix and it was all I could get on short notice. I was really pleasantly surprised. The staff were delightful, the room well equipped. I particularly appreciated the built in desk/table along the window. The breakfast and dinners were inexpensive, but great for the price. And there is a little garden where you can have your meals. The shower was especially nice for an American, a real shower head."

The old town itself was well kept with limited auto traffic, narrow streets, lots of shops, excellent restaurants and frequent markets around the many squares. The grounds around the property were exceptional with walks around gardens, olive orchards and a pine forest with a view down on the town.  The accommodations were very comfortable with an arbored patio, dining area, and spacious bedrooms.  The proprietors were kind, charming and most helpful to a group of weary travelers looking for a nice peaceful stay. Not a thing!"

Because the air conditioning is in the living area, the bedroom does not get as cool as the rest of the apartment. But eventually, it was acceptable. To be fair, it was extremely hot when I stayed in Aix. The temperature was around 100°F."

She was patient and really helpful to all our queries on the platform, whether it was the PIN code or the cooker stove. This is much appreciated. The location is simply outstanding with Carrefour and Monoprix just downstairs and allowed us to get what we need very conveniently for a 10day stay. I would highly recommend this property for a couple or singles or a short term stay. If I have to pick one thing, it would be that the cups were not so clean when we checked in. We have everything we need to live there like it’s our apartment so no major issue with that."

La posizione è perfetta per girare il centro a piedi, ma non c'è il parcheggio auto. Ci sarebbe un parcheggio interrato a pochi passi ma è nella zona ztl e piuttosto caro. Noi abbiamo parcheggio lungo una strada a circa 700 mt. Non c'è l'ascensore e le scale sono impegnative con i bagagli che è meglio siano piccoli. La cucina non è attrezzata di niente, se non un paio di tazze e bicchieri e posate. Nemmeno un cavatappi,  ci siamo fatti aprire la bottiglia dal bar sotto.\nLa prima sera c'era un dj che suonava nel bar, e si sentiva un pochino di rumore fino a tardi, ma non troppo disturbante."

Den smala, sneda trappan till fjärde våningen är svår för den som är mindre rörlig. \nLägenheten hade brandvarnare men kanske skulle det också finnas brandsläckare i lägenheterna med hänsyn till den smala trappan."

Skönt med välfungerande AC. Fel adress och kod!\nDet stod fel adress och fel portkod i bokningen! Det blev en hel del krångel med det. Jag lyckades hitta trots fel adress enbart genom envishet - och lyckades komma in genom porten trots fel kod, enbart pga andra gäster som lyckades få tag på uthyraren (som inte pratade engelska). \n\nSmutsiga lakan! \nJag kan stå ut med lite damm - men förväntar mig rena lakan som ett minimum. Här var lakanen uppenbart redan använda. Rätt äckligt. Jag fick leta efter andra lakan i en låda och byta själv innan jag kunde lägga mig. Dock fanns inga andra örngott, så troligen sov jag på redan använda… \n\nStort minus. \n\nDet låg också smutsiga bestick i kökslådorna och det var inte helt rent överlag. \n\nSynd på annars så väldigt fint boende!"

Comfy bed, nicely decorated spaces and compact kitchen. Really good shower. It's ground floor but felt secure - electric shutters were easy to use and ensured privacy at night. It is a little dark but I wasn't in there much during the day."

There is also bus to go to Aix and Marseille not far, but I only know that after Ms grandma tell me. \nBreakfast is fresh and well prepared, I can also sit outside to enjoy it."
